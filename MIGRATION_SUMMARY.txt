DATABASE MIGRATION SOLUTION - SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT WAS CREATED:
-----------------

1. Migration Scripts (in scripts/ folder):
   ✓ migrate-database.ts      - Main migration script
   ✓ compare-databases.ts     - Pre-migration comparison tool
   ✓ verify-migration.ts      - Post-migration verification

2. NPM Commands (added to package.json):
   ✓ npm run db:compare       - Compare old and new databases
   ✓ npm run db:migrate       - Execute the migration
   ✓ npm run db:verify        - Verify migration success

3. Documentation:
   ✓ MIGRATION_QUICK_START.md     - Quick reference (4 steps)
   ✓ DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md  - Comprehensive guide
   ✓ README_MIGRATION.md          - Complete solution overview
   ✓ MIGRATION_SUMMARY.txt        - This file

4. Updated Files:
   ✓ package.json                 - Added migration commands
   ✓ README.md                    - Added migration section

================================================================================
HOW TO USE:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Configure .env.local
-----------------------------
Add these lines to your .env.local file:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://new_user:new_pass@new_host:5432/new_db
OLD_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://old_user:old_pass@old_host:5432/old_db

(Replace with your actual database connection strings)

STEP 2: Compare Databases (Optional but Recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------
npm run db:compare

This shows you:
- Record counts in both databases
- What will be migrated
- Potential conflicts
- Estimated migration impact

STEP 3: Run Migration
---------------------
npm run db:migrate

This will:
- Export all data from old database
- Create JSON backups in data/migration-backup/
- Import data to new database (skipping duplicates)
- Show detailed progress and summary

STEP 4: Verify Migration
------------------------
npm run db:verify

This checks:
- All tables exist
- Record counts
- Indexes created
- Data integrity
- Sample data

================================================================================
KEY FEATURES:
================================================================================

✓ SAFE & NON-DESTRUCTIVE
  - Never deletes existing data in new database
  - Skips duplicates instead of overwriting
  - Old database remains unchanged

✓ AUTOMATIC BACKUPS
  - All data backed up to JSON files
  - Saved in data/migration-backup/
  - Can be used for recovery if needed

✓ SMART CONFLICT RESOLUTION
  - Alerts & Orders: Skips duplicates by ID
  - Ticker Cache: Merges data intelligently

✓ DETAILED LOGGING
  - Shows progress for each step
  - Reports imported vs skipped records
  - Provides verification results

================================================================================
WHAT GETS MIGRATED:
================================================================================

Tables:
- alerts           (Trading alerts from TradingView/ChartInk)
- placed_orders    (Orders placed through Dhan API)
- ticker_cache     (Cache to prevent duplicate orders)

Indexes:
- All performance indexes are recreated
- 9 indexes total across all tables

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
================================================================================

When you run the migration:

1. Both databases are tested for connectivity
2. Schema is created in new database (if not exists)
3. Data is exported from old database
4. JSON backups are created
5. Data is imported to new database
6. Duplicates are automatically skipped
7. Summary shows: exported / imported / skipped counts

Example Output:
  Alerts: 150 exported, 105 imported, 45 skipped
  Orders: 200 exported, 180 imported, 20 skipped

"Skipped" records are those that already exist in the new database.
This is NORMAL and EXPECTED behavior.

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

Connection Failed?
- Check your DATABASE_URL and OLD_DATABASE_URL
- Ensure both databases are accessible
- Verify credentials are correct

Many Records Skipped?
- This is normal if new database already has data
- Check backup JSON files to see what was exported
- Skipped records are duplicates (already exist)

Need to Re-run?
- Safe to run multiple times
- Won't create duplicates
- Will only import new records

================================================================================
POST-MIGRATION:
================================================================================

After successful migration:

1. ✓ Review the summary output
2. ✓ Run: npm run db:verify
3. ✓ Test your application
4. ✓ Remove OLD_DATABASE_URL from .env.local
5. ✓ Keep backups in data/migration-backup/ for safety

Your application will automatically use the new database since
DATABASE_URL in .env.local points to it.

================================================================================
SUPPORT:
================================================================================

If you encounter issues:

1. Check backup files in data/migration-backup/
2. Review console output for specific errors
3. Run npm run db:verify to check current state
4. Consult DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for troubleshooting

Remember: The migration is designed to be safe. You can run it multiple
times if needed, and your data is always backed up.
