# ✅ Migration Ready!

## Summary

Your database migration is now fully configured and ready to run.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Checked Both Databases
- **Old DB**: 6 tables found
- **New DB**: 3 tables found (missing user tables)

### 2. ✅ Created Missing Tables in New DB
The following tables were created in your new database:
- `users` (with 8 indexes)
- `user_sessions` (with 3 indexes)
- `user_audit_log` (with 3 indexes)

### 3. ✅ Verified Schema Compatibility
- All table schemas match between old and new databases
- No data type differences
- All columns are compatible

### 4. ✅ Updated Migration Script
The migration script now includes all 6 tables:
- `alerts` (202 rows to migrate)
- `placed_orders` (331 rows to migrate)
- `ticker_cache` (167 rows to migrate)
- `users` (3 rows to migrate)
- `user_sessions` (58 rows to migrate)
- `user_audit_log` (61 rows to migrate)

## What Will Be Migrated

| Table | Old DB | New DB | To Migrate | Conflicts |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| alerts | 202 | 17 | 202 | 0 |
| placed_orders | 331 | 4 | 331 | 0 |
| ticker_cache | 167 | 0 | 167 | 0 |
| users | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| user_sessions | 58 | 0 | 58 | 0 |
| user_audit_log | 61 | 0 | 61 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **822** | **21** | **822** | **0** |

## Expected Result

After migration, your new database will have:
- **Alerts**: ~219 records (17 existing + 202 migrated)
- **Orders**: ~335 records (4 existing + 331 migrated)
- **Cache**: ~167 records (0 existing + 167 migrated)
- **Users**: ~3 records (0 existing + 3 migrated)
- **Sessions**: ~58 records (0 existing + 58 migrated)
- **Audit Logs**: ~61 records (0 existing + 61 migrated)

**Total**: ~843 records across all tables

## Run the Migration

Execute this command:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

## What Happens During Migration

1. ✅ Test connections to both databases
2. ✅ Initialize schema (already done)
3. ✅ Export alerts from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
4. ✅ Export orders from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
5. ✅ Export cache from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
6. ✅ Export users from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
7. ✅ Export sessions from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
8. ✅ Export audit logs from old DB → Backup to JSON → Import to new DB
9. ✅ Verify migration
10. ✅ Show summary

## Backups

All data will be backed up to:
```
data/migration-backup/
├── alerts-[timestamp].json
├── placed_orders-[timestamp].json
├── ticker_cache-[timestamp].json
├── users-[timestamp].json
├── user_sessions-[timestamp].json
└── user_audit_log-[timestamp].json
```

## Safety Features

- ✅ **Non-destructive**: Old database unchanged
- ✅ **Automatic backups**: All data saved to JSON
- ✅ **Conflict resolution**: Skips duplicates
- ✅ **Verification**: Post-migration checks
- ✅ **Re-runnable**: Safe to run multiple times

## After Migration

1. Run verification:
   ```bash
   npm run db:verify
   ```

2. Test your application:
   ```bash
   npm run test:db
   ```

3. Remove `OLD_DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local`

4. Keep backups for safety

## Configuration

Your `.env.local` is configured:
- ✅ `OLD_DATABASE_URL`: ep-patient-cherry (US East)
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL`: ep-young-snow (AP Southeast)

## Ready to Go!

Everything is set up. Run the migration when you're ready:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

Expected duration: ~1-2 minutes for 822 records
